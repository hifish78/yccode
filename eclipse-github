#How to upload an Eclipse project to GitHub?
(We have an Eclipse project on local. We would like to push the local Eclipse project source code to GitHub Repo.)
1) create a GitHub Repo (e.g: https://github.com/hifish78/yccode.git)

2) New a project in Eclipse 
   New a Project named "myproject" (e.g: Java Project) In Eclipse.
   The project should be in Eclipse workspace area (e.g: /Documents/worksapce/myproject)

3) Create a local git repo for the project and change working dir to git repo
   selected "myproject" -> Team (right click)->"Share Project" (Git) -> Repository (create,choose:/Downloads/ycprojects/myproject-repo") 
   Note:
   For "Repository",it will be "myproject - /Downloads/ycprojects/myproject-repo/.git
   For "myproject", Current Location is: /Documents/workspace/myproject; Target Location is: /Download/ycprojects/myproject-repo/myproject
